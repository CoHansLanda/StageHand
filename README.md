# discord-bot
This is a simple discord bot with the following functionalities:
  Command to give basic movie information like runtime, ratings, aspect        ratio and the total box office gross.\n
  Command to mute everyone in the voicechannel when the movie begins.
  Command to allow a person to request to skip forward or rewind (it also generates a poll for this so that everyone can vote on it)
  Command to compare two movies (returns IMDB and Rotten Tomato ratings)
  Command to provide summary for the movie and also find the director of a movie
  Command to find the top billed cast of the movie
  Command that shows the biography, films and awards won by an actor
  
  
  This bot was created using the discordpy and imdb module with webscraping (using Selenium) present as a backup (as many times the imdb module was not giving the right ID)
